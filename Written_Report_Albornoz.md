- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
**Campaigns launched in May and June are the most successful ones** followed by those launched on July.
The curve of the *failed* campaigns is very similar to the one of the *successful* ones, suggesting there might be a somewhat steady relation between success, failed vs started. There are two exceptions: in comparison, the failed curve is a bit flatter for the good months (May to July), confirming the conclusion above, and it grows instead of decreasing for December from which I infer that **December is the worse month to start a campaign**.
In other words, if based just on this analysis, we could recommend launching a campaign between May and Jun and avoid launching it in December
The campaigns with goals below 5K have the highest *success percentage*. Conversely campaigns with goals 45K and up have the lowest *success percentage*.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
For this part of the analysis we are not considering the amount pledged, thus we’re not considering how close (or far) a campaign that failed was to be successful. Also seems would be wise to consider the number of campaigns when trying to reach conclusions, for example one might be tempted to say that a campaign with a goal 35 to 50K is more likely to be successful (66% successful percentage) vs say one in the $5 to 15K ranges (~55%) – however the total campaigns in the later range is way larger than the ones in the former one so perhaps even if the success percentage is larger, does not necessarily mean that a campaign with a goal in the higher range  has better chances to be successful.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
For this part of the analysis, we are not considering the amount pledged, thus we’re not considering how close (or far) a campaign that failed was to be successful. Also seems would be wise to consider the number of campaigns when trying to reach conclusions, for example one might be tempted to say that a campaign with a goal 35 to 50K is more likely to be successful (66% successful percentage) vs say one in the $5 to 15K ranges (~55%) – however the total campaigns in the later range is way larger than the ones in the former one so perhaps even if the success percentage is larger, does not necessarily mean that a campaign with a goal in the higher range  has better chances to be successful.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
Some would be pledges vs goals, pledges vs launch date, and find a way to create some context in relationship to the total of campaigns if/when analyzing percentage of success and total pledges per month vs total campaigns and goals to see if there is a relationship. We should also consider filter down further to analyze deeper data for projects closer *Louise’s*
